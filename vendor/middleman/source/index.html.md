description: The DataCite DOI registration API.
---

The [DataCite MDS API](https://support.datacite.org/docs/mds-api-guide) allows users to register DataCite DOIs and associated metadata. Use [DOI Fabrica](https://support.datacite.org/docs/about-fabrica) as the complimentary web interface. The API requires authentication via a member or client account. To become a member, interested parties should contact [DataCite support](mailto:support@datacite.org), client accounts are provided by existing members. To retrieve DOI metadata records users should use our [DataCite REST API](https://api.datacite.org). 

You will find more information about the MDS API in our [documentation portal](https://support.datacite.org/docs/mds-api-guide).
